					HELP(Interface) : Page 01/01
	
	* This module contains the Graphical-User-Interface [G.U.I] that assists the user
	  to browse Through the available functions and modules with Ease. They can also be
	  tested by user input right within the G.U.I but with limitations on customization.
	  It is better to use the G.U.I instead of HELP() if you are interested in having
	  a quick look at everything available without having to type each command for every 
	  function/module in the HELP() function. The G.U.I also ignores all pre-made print
	  statements functions.
	 
	* MainPage(): <=--= The Graphical-User-Interface
	
	* This function also has a strict mode, where the User cannot access the Unstable
	  Functions unless and until the user enables Experimental Mode.
